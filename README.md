# Anki Computer Vision

There are a number of sub-projects here (or will be!).

These include

1. simple-tracking - A project that does a simple analysis of frames to find moving cars. The output of this could plausibly be used to build a more interesting tracker using, say, convolutional nets.

2. your-project-here - Check in whatever you want here!
